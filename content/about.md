Hexops is a little place, and eventual company, for creating games.

I've led [an arduous journey into game development](https://devlog.hexops.com/2021/increasing-my-contribution-to-zig-to-200-a-month), spending 4 years learning about game engines full-time, then 7 years [building developer tools](http://slimsag.com) and a thriving startup ([Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com)). Over the past few years, I've been working double-time [writing code 100 hours/week](https://devlog.hexops.com/2021/I-write-code-100-hours-a-week) working towards eventually executing on a self-funded 10 year game development do-or-die plan.

## Motivation

Despite spending ~4 years writing my own game engine full-time back in 2015, when I finished university it was clear to me that gamedev was just not a viable or good career. Instead, I chose to go into developer tools joining [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com) over 7 years ago.

Since then, I've learned so much, seen so much, and solidified my view that the gamedev industry is fundamentally broken: companies like EA games* edge towards literally getting children addicted to gambling, those like Telltale Games* violate federal labor laws, those like Blizzard* have rampant and systemic sexual harrassment in their DNA, and the entire industry creeps more and more towards a house-always-wins casino gambling ring of profit-driven motives than actual care for players. 

I'm regularly dumbfounded by how slow and bearacratic these companies are. By how players _want_ them to listen to them and bring the game in a better direction, all while being ignored or getting an empty promise from a PR team. Quality of games are sufferring.

Game companies are in a race to the bottom-I'd like to flip this on it's head, and release games you _want_ to pay for.

## State of Hexops today

Most of my time goes to [Mach engine](https://machengine.org), laying the groundwork for future games I want to publish. Development of Mach engine is pretty much full-time for me, with ad-hoc part-time contributions from others. I still hold a full-time position at [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com) so I'm working double-time, 24/7.

In the coming years, I anticipate shifting 100% of my time to Hexops and embarking on that self-funded 10-year journey to make some decent games. We're not there yet, though.
