Hexops is a little place, and eventual company, for creating games.
I&amp;rsquo;ve led an arduous journey into game development, spending 4 years learning about game engines full-time, then 7 years building developer tools and a thriving startup (Sourcegraph). Over the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working double-time writing code 100 hours/week working towards eventually executing on a self-funded 10 year game development do-or-die plan.
Motivation Despite spending ~4 years writing my own game engine full-time back in 2015, when I finished university it was clear to me that gamedev was just not a viable or good career.</description></item><item><title>Privacy matters</title><link>https://hexops.com/privacy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hexops.com/privacy/</guid><description>Analytics should always be minimal, 100% anonymous, aggregated, and open to the public - otherwise itâ€™s spying. We believe in your right to anonymity and privacy. We believe in creating games worth paying for, not exploiting you for money. Our systems gather the smallest amount of data needed to learn how to actually improve our games, and to prove it we give you and everyone else 100% full access to all our data and tools.</description></item></channel></rss>
