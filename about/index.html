Hexops is a little place, and eventual company, for creating games.
I&rsquo;ve led an arduous journey into game development, spending 4 years learning about game engines full-time, then 7 years building developer tools and a thriving startup (Sourcegraph). Over the past few years, I&rsquo;ve been working double-time writing code 100 hours/week working towards eventually executing on a self-funded 10 year game development do-or-die plan.
Motivation Despite spending ~4 years writing my own game engine full-time back in 2015, when I finished university it was clear to me that gamedev was just not a viable or good career."><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:url" content="https://hexops.com/about/"><meta property="article:section" content><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="About Hexops"><meta name=twitter:description content="Author: Stephen Gutekanst

Instead, I chose to go into developer tools joining <a href=https://sourcegraph.com>Sourcegraph</a> over 7 years ago.</p><p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve learned so much, seen so much, and solidified my view that the gamedev industry is fundamentally broken: companies like EA games* edge towards literally getting children addicted to gambling, those like Telltale Games* violate federal labor laws, those like Blizzard* have rampant and systemic sexual harrassment in their DNA, and the entire industry creeps more and more towards a house-always-wins casino gambling ring of profit-driven motives than actual care for players.</p><p>I&rsquo;m regularly dumbfounded by how slow and bureaucratic these companies are. By how players <em>want</em> them to listen to them and bring the game in a better direction, all while being ignored or getting an empty promise from a PR team. Quality of games are sufferring.</p><p>Game companies are in a race to the bottom-I&rsquo;d like to flip this on it&rsquo;s head, and release games you <em>want</em> to pay for.</p><p><small><em>* Allegedly, these are opinions not facts</em></small></p><h2 id=state-of-hexops-today>State of Hexops today</h2><p>Most of my time goes to <a href=https://machengine.org>Mach engine</a>, laying the groundwork for future games I want to publish. Development of Mach engine is pretty much full-time for me, with ad-hoc part-time contributions from others. I still hold a full-time position at <a href=https://sourcegraph.com>Sourcegraph</a> so I&rsquo;m working double-time, 24/7.</p><p>In the coming years, I anticipate shifting 100% of my time to Hexops and embarking on that self-funded 10-year journey to make some decent games. We&rsquo;re not there yet, though.</p></div></main></div><div class=footer><a href=/privacy>Privacy matters</a><p><a href=https://devlog.hexops.com/>Hexops' devlog</a> |
